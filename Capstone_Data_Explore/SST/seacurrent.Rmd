# Currents in the Santa Barbara Channel. The file is a netCDF at 1km spatial scale downloaded from [here](https://dods.ndbc.noaa.gov/thredds/ncss/grid/hfradar_uswc_1km/dataset.html). I also filtered to our area of interest coordinates which are also available in the data explore repo on kelpgeomod


```{r}
# Read in packages
library(ncdf4)
library(tidync)
library(raster)
library(tmap)
```


```{r}
# Read in the file

currents_file <- nc_open("/Users/jfrench/Documents/MEDS/Capstone/DATA/hfradar_uswc_1km.nc")
```

```{r}
# view metadata
current_attributes <- arcticdatautils::get_ncdf4_attributes(currents_file)
```

```{r}
# pull out lat and lon
lon <- ncvar_get(currents_file, "lon")
lat <- ncvar_get(currents_file, "lat")

# Pull out one variable, u

u <- ncvar_get(currents_file, "u") |> 
  as.matrix()


```

```{r}
# try to plot u

# rasterize u
raster_u <- raster(u, xmn=min(lon), xmx=max(lon), ymn=min(lat), ymx=max(lat), 
                   crs = "EPSG: 4326")

plot(u)
```
