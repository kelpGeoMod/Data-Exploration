```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# Read in the data



```




```{r}
# Check CRS (do we want NAD 83 or WGS 84? what's been more common?), spatial resolution, and temporal resolution, and document these
# We can compare the defaults across all data sets to see what would be the most useful values to maintain for all data sets?
```




```{r}
# Create a geometry column if needed from latitude and longitude
```




```{r}
# Summarize the measurements so that they are on the agreed upon common temporal resolution
```




```{r}
# Use spatial interpolation to get measurements on the agreed upon common spatial scale
# Would we want auto kriging? https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/02/automatic-spatial-interpolation-with-r-the-automap-package/
# Aggregating option https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32278825/how-to-change-the-resolution-of-a-raster-layer-in-r
```





```{r}
# Join data set into whichever other data sets are ready via the geometry column (or another consistent ID?)
```
